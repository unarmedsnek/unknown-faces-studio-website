        question: "Can I bring my own producer or engineer?",

        answer2: "Also, if needed, we can offer our producer or team members who will help with recording, creative, or technical questions and contribute to bringing your vision to life.",

        answer2: "If you don't notify us in time about not showing up or cancelling, a symbolic penalty of €10 will be applied, which will be added to your next studio package purchase. This policy helps ensure smooth studio scheduling, as unannounced studio time remains unused.",
